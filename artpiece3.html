  <p>This is a collection of drawings that were drawn each time I experienced intense anxiety during my daily life. I called this piece “Piece of Mind,” where each day I would draw 3 or more drawings based on my paranoia, each projecting a different feeling, emotion, anxiety, panic, etc. that I would feel throughout that day. My intention was to accumulate all of my drawings around a mirror in the center and completed the installation to resemble a detective/forensics wall. I wanted to create an experience of being trapped within one's self and then being surrounded by consistent, overwhelming emotions/thoughts that all connect back to you, the one who is trapped.

  <p> This was a project I worked on as a way of coping through school, and transitioning into quarantine, and then coping with primarily being in my home environment. It was certainly a handful, but a handful I found peace in holding. It allowed to me to feel free with my emotions and to draw when I felt trapped and allowing that expression to paint itself onto paper. I would take my sketchbooks to me wherever I would go: on the bus, sitting in student union, studying in the library, eating lunch, relaxing at home/in my room, in classes, etc. I would quickly sketch how I was feeling, and by the end of the day come back to it to do line art and enhancements and rip it out and put it on my wall. The more the wall built up with images, the more it  It allowed to see myself in a new way, how my brain functioned throughout the day, how my anxiety persisted consistently in everything I did, no matter where I was there was some sort of emotional explosion. </p>
