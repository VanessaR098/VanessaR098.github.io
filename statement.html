  <p> I am the artist Vanessa Rivera, aka Finesse Vaness :) In my art, I like to capture the beauty of self love, self awareness, and bring forth personal mental struggles that my audience can grasp a better understanding of or sympathize/empathize with. </p>

  <p>2019 is currently my first year as a Digital Media Art Student, thus many of the mediums I have learned were all a new learning experience for me. Of course, all of which were exciting for me to learn! The mediums my artworks have revolved around were digital video with Premiere, websites and coding as art with HTMl, CSS, and JS, and digital photos with Photoshop and Art illustrator. As a new art student, many of my artworks don't follow a consistent theme in each since I was exploring different passions. Therefore, my works range from early childhood memories to self awareness and awareness of anxiety and mental instability. I want to bring light on to these issues, specifically with self awareness and awareness of mental instability, especially when it is so easy to be consumed with our alternate realities and our inner frustrations.  </p>

  <p>One of my most recent projects "I Can't Help It" focused specifically on awareness of mental instability, primarily anxiety (however any fitting mental issue can be applied). I created the website with the intention of lacking any initial visual information that could give away what the website may be about, in addition to a discussion between two characters who lacked identification. I not only wanted to mimic a personal experience depicting the internal struggles of mental instability, but to make the experience interactive and accessible to the user to thus undergo what this struggle feels like. I hope that this project presents itself as an eye opener to the "demons" some of us have to face in our everyday lives, especially because there is a common misconception that mental instability is just merely an over exaggeration of emotions, but in reality it is much more than that. </p>
